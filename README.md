# Unlocking Athlete Performance: A Multilevel Approach for Evaluating Contributions in Basketball

In the world of sport, data-driven decision-making has become increasingly important. In this paper, we present a novel method for evaluating the performance of athletes and teams that includes a season-long evaluation system, a single-game evaluation, and an evaluation of an athlete's contribution. Our approach is based on mixed-effects regression models that take into account the hierarchical structure of the data and principal component analysis to calculate an athlete rating. We apply our methodology to a large dataset of NBA games spanning four seasons from 2015-2016 to 2018-2019. Our model is validated using two systematic approaches, and our results demonstrate the reliability of our approach to predict Oliveira-Newell scores for new games or seasons. This provides coaches and managers with a powerful tool to gain deeper insights into their players' performance, make more informed decisions and ultimately improve their team's performance. Our methodology has several key advantages. First, by incorporating the hierarchical structure of the data, we can obtain valuable information about an athlete's contribution within their team. Second, the use of principal component analysis allows us to calculate a single score that captures the overall performance of an athlete. Third, our approach is based on classical restricted likelihood methods, which makes the calculation faster than Bayesian methods with 1,000 posterior samples. The potential applications of our methodology are enormous. With our approach, coaches and managers can evaluate athletes' performance throughout the season, compare athletes and teams over a year, and assess an athlete's performance during a single game. Our methodology can also complement other ratings and box score metrics to provide a more comprehensive assessment of an athlete's performance. In summary, our methodology represents a significant contribution to the field of sports analytics and provides the foundation for future developments. By combining data-driven insights with expert knowledge, our approach can help develop successful strategies for teams and athletes. We believe that our methodology has the potential to revolutionise the way we analyse sports data, not only in basketball but also in other sports, and ultimately help teams achieve their goals.
